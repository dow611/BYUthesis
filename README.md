# BYUthesis
A simple Latex template for a BYU thesis or dissertation.

This package attempts to address all of BYU's graduate thesis/dissertation requirements in a clean template. Late nights struggling with unwieldy Latex files is likely the last thing a grad student wants. The hope is that version-controlled source files facilitates a simple, clean template that is easy to maintain and update with the latest requirements.

See ADV Form 11* for current requirements: https://gradstudies.byu.edu/page/advisement-forms
From what I've been told, these are the only requirements at the university level. While not well-documented, this package also attempts to address the more particular formatting requirements of the Ira. A. Fulton College of Engineering and Technology.
