# BYUthesis
A simple Latex template for a BYU thesis or dissertation.

This package attempts to address all of BYU's graduate thesis/dissertation requirements in a clean template. Late nights struggling with unwieldy Latex files is likely the last thing a grad student wants. The hope is that version-controlled source files facilitates a simple, clean template that is easy to maintain and update with the latest requirements.
